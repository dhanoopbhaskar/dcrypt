dcrypt
======

It is a simple android application for encryption and decryption of files using passphrase. Supported API levels are in the range 10 (min) and 17 (max).

To encrypt a file, what you need is to share the file to "DCrypt" and enter a passphrase. To decrypt the file, you have to share the encrypted file to the application and enter the passphrase. 
Obviously the passphrase for encryption and decryption should be the same.
